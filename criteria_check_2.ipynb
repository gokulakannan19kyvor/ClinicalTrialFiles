Participants who undergo an attempted research biopsy procedure for the purpose of this protocol, and in whom inadequate tissue is obtained, are not required to undergo a repeat biopsy in order to continue on protocol.\\nThe effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, both women and men of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (Section 5.5.2) starting with the first dose of study therapy and for the duration of study participation, through 120 days after the last dose of study medication.\\n\\nNote: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. While on the study, women may not breast-feed. Women of childbearing potential are defined as those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for > 1 year.\\n\\nFemale subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.

Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with pembrolizumab.\\nActive infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at week 1 day 1.\\nIndividuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin. Participants with other cancers diagnosed within the past 5 years and felt to be at low risk of recurrence should be discussed with the study sponsor to determine eligibility.\\nThe participant has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive medication including disease modifying agents, or has required such therapy in the last 2 years. Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\\nThe participant has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease or syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.\\nThe participant is known to be positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen, or Hepatitis C RNA. Testing for screening is not required.\\nKnown HIV-positive participants.HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with pembrolizumab. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections with bone marrow suppressive therapy, i.e. nab-paclitaxel. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated. Testing for screening is not required.\\nThe participant has received a live vaccine within 28 days of planned start of study therapy.\\nSeasonal influenza vaccines for infection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (i.e. Flu-Mist ®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.\"]\n",

Pre-clinical data was suggestive of a teratogenic effect of eribulin mesylate. Pertuzumab caused oligohydramnios, delayed renal development and embryo-fetal deaths in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys. In the post-marketing setting, cases of oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia of the fetus have been reported in pregnant women receiving trastuzumab. For these reasons women of child bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.

All females must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of β-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (β-Hcg) at the Baseline visit [within 7 days of the first dose of study treatment]). Females of childbearing potential must agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception (e.g., abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double-barrier method such as condom + spermicidal or condom + diaphragm with spermicidal, a contraceptive implant, an oral contraceptive or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment. The only subjects who will be exempt from this requirement are postmenopausal women (defined as women who have been amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age group, without other known or suspected primary cause) or subjects who have been sterilized surgically or who are otherwise proven sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation with surgery at least 1 month before start of study treatment, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy with surgery at least 1 month before start of study treatment). Current, ongoing protocols containing pertuzumab have included continuous pregnancy monitoring during the trial and for six months after the last dose of study drug is administered. Because of the long half-life of pertuzumab, women should be warned not to become pregnant for at least six months after completion of treatment.\\nIndividuals with a history of different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy.
